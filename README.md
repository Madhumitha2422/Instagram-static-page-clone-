### HTML Files

- `index.html`: The landing page with login and signup forms.


### CSS Files

- `styles.css`: Global styles for the entire website.

### Images

The `images/` directory contains the logo and user avatar images used throughout the website. The `post-images/` subdirectory holds the images for the post cards on the feed page and you can also use unsplash if you don't want to download the images for post

## Usage

To run the project locally, simply open the HTML files in a web browser. For example, to view the landing page, open `index.html`.


This project was created for educational purposes and is inspired by the design and functionality of the official Instagram website.
